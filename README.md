The can2040 project is a software CANbus implementation for Raspberry
Pi
[rp2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html)
micro-controllers.  It enables an rp2040 chip to implement
[CANbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) using a standard CAN
transceiver chip.

The code supports reading and writing CAN 2.0B data frames at rates up
to 1Mbit per second.  See the [API document](docs/API.md) for
information on using can2040.

This is a software implementation of CANbus.  See the [features
document](docs/Features.md) for details about the implementation.
