The can2040 project is a software CANbus implementation for Raspberry
Pi rp2040 chips.  It enables an rp2040 chip to implement
[CANbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) using a standard CAN
transceiver chip.

This project is currently under active development.  The current code
can read and write standard CANbus data frames, however there are
several known limitations.
